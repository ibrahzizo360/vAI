# vAI PWA Development Log

**Date: 2025-07-23**

**Activity:** Initial setup and core UI implementation.

1.  **`tailwind.config.ts`**:
    *   Configured custom colors: `primary` (#003366 - Deep Navy), `secondary` (#F3F6F8 - Light Grey), `accent-green` (#2ECC71 - Emerald Green), `accent-red` (#E74C3C - Red).
    *   Set `fontFamily.sans` to `Inter` for clarity and accessibility as per PRD.
    *   Added `tailwindcss-animate` plugin.

2.  **`app/layout.tsx`**:
    *   Set up the root layout with `Inter` font.
    *   Included `ThemeProvider` from shadcn/ui, defaulting to `light` theme.
    *   Added PWA metadata (`manifest.json`, `icon-192x192.png`) for installability.
    *   Made `app/layout.tsx` a client component (`'use client'`).
    *   Moved `useState` hooks (`showReviewModal`, `currentTranscriptData`) and `handleRecordingStop` function from `app/page.tsx` to `app/layout.tsx`.
    *   Rendered `FloatingRecordingControls` and `TranscriptReviewModal` directly within `app/layout.tsx` to make them globally available.

3.  **`app/page.tsx` (Home/Dashboard)**:
    *   Created the main dashboard page.
    *   Replaced the `Sheet` (hamburger menu) with the new `Sidebar` component.
    *   Adjusted the main content's `margin-left` to `ml-20` to accommodate the new slimmer sidebar.
    *   Removed `RecentTranscriptsList` and its associated heading. The dashboard now has a simpler welcome message.
    *   Removed `FloatingRecordingControls` and `TranscriptReviewModal` components, as they are now in `app/layout.tsx`.
    *   Removed `useState` hooks and `handleRecordingStop` function.
    *   Added a "Listening for 'Hey vAI'" indicator.
    *   Added `sticky top-0 z-10` to the `header` for sticky behavior.

4.  **`app/record/page.tsx` (Recording Screen)**:
    *   **Deleted**: This page has been removed.

5.  **`app/tag/page.tsx` (Tagging Screen)**:
    *   **Deleted**: Functionality moved into `TranscriptReviewModal`.

6.  **`app/review/page.tsx` (Transcript Review Page)**:
    *   **Deleted**: Functionality moved into `TranscriptReviewModal`.

7.  **`app/history/page.tsx` (History/Calendar Page)**:
    *   Implemented the history view.
    *   Expanded `allTranscripts` data to simulate more than 20 entries.
    *   Implemented `useState` for `visibleTranscriptsCount` and a `loadMoreTranscripts` function for pagination.
    *   Reorganized filter inputs into a `flex flex-wrap` container for horizontal alignment and responsiveness.
    *   Redesigned `Card` components for individual transcripts to be slimmer (`p-3`, smaller text/icon sizes) and responsive (`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
    *   Added a "Load More" button, conditionally rendered.
    *   Added `sticky top-0 z-10` to the `header` for sticky behavior.

8.  **`app/patients/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Updated**: Changed the main content container to `w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6` for consistency with `/history`.
    *   **Updated**: Realigned the search input and "Add Patient" button into a `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4` container for horizontal alignment and responsiveness.
    *   **Updated**: Redesigned individual patient `Card` components to be slimmer (`p-3`, smaller text/icon sizes) and responsive (`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
    *   Added `sticky top-0 z-10` to the `header` for sticky behavior.
    *   Modified the `Link` for "View Details" to point to `patients/${patient.id}`.

9.  **`app/patients/[id]/page.tsx` (New file)**:
    *   Created a dynamic route for individual patient case details.
    *   Displays placeholder data for clinical summaries, intraoperative details, and follow-up milestones.
    *   Integrates `CaseDetailsSection`, `MediaUploadCard`, `AiInsightsCard`, and `FollowUpRemindersCard` components.
    *   Includes a "Back to Patients List" button in the header.
    *   Header is sticky.

10. **`components/custom/floating-record-button.tsx`**:
    *   **Deleted**: Replaced by `floating-recording-controls.tsx`.

11. **`components/custom/floating-recording-controls.tsx` (Refactored file)**:
    *   Now accepts an `onRecordingStop` prop to pass the simulated transcript back to the parent (`app/layout.tsx`).
    *   The "Stop" button no longer navigates directly but triggers the `onRecordingStop` callback.
    *   Simulates a transcript upon stopping the recording.
    *   Removed the `usePathname()` check, allowing the component to render on all pages.

12. **`components/custom/recent-transcripts-list.tsx`**:
    *   This component is no longer used in the current UI flow as its functionality has been absorbed by `app/history/page.tsx`. I will keep the file but it's effectively deprecated for this project.

13. **`components/custom/waveform-visualizer.tsx`**:
    *   This component is no longer directly used in the current UI flow.

14. **`components/custom/medical-syntax-highlighter.tsx`**:
    *   A component that takes a text string and highlights predefined medical terms.

15. **`components/custom/sidebar.tsx` (Updated file)**:
    *   Changed width to `w-20` (slimmer).
    *   Background color set to `bg-[#E4F2FF]` (light blue).
    *   Text/icon color set to `text-black`.
    *   Navigation items now display only icons (`Home`, `Clock` for Recent, `Users` for Patients, `Settings`, `HelpCircle`).
    *   Added `sr-only` for screen reader accessibility for icon-only links.

16. **`components/custom/transcript-review-modal.tsx` (Updated file)**:
    *   Removed the redundant "Cancel" button at the bottom. The `DialogClose` (X icon) at the top right is now the sole close mechanism.
    *   Confirmed the `Tag` icon's positioning within the "Context Type" `Select` component is correct and consistent with other input fields.
    *   Combines the review and tagging functionalities.
    *   Uses `Dialog` from shadcn/ui for the modal structure.
    *   Displays the transcript, AI summary, and fields for Patient ID, Context Type, and Optional Remarks.
    *   Includes "Edit Transcript", "Re-run Summary", and "Approve & Export" buttons.
    *   The "Approve & Export" button closes the modal and simulates data handling.

17. **`components/custom/case-details-section.tsx` (New file)**:
    *   Reusable component for displaying structured case data with an edit icon.

18. **`components/custom/media-upload-card.tsx` (New file)**:
    *   Component for simulating file uploads (images, videos, text notes) with drag-and-drop area.

19. **`components/custom/ai-insights-card.tsx` (New file)**:
    *   Component to display AI-generated insights, including missing field alerts and structured case synopses.

20. **`components/custom/follow-up-reminders-card.tsx` (New file)**:
    *   Component to display automated follow-up reminders with due dates and status.
